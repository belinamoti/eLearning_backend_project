For this project I used ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to perform database operations by mapping to the database tables, and the SQLAlchemy ORM is being used to perform CRUD operations on these tables. I also directly executed raw SQL statements using the psycopg2 library to interact with a PostgreSQL database by creating sample values for my tables.

I used Flask-SQLAlchemy to build a database for an online learning platform.

I defined Flask api routes for interacting with the model.
